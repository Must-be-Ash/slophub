I want to target 14-35 year old developers and vibe coders and tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs and I want this funnel to lead to https://www.x402.org/ encouraging people to build with x402 protocol.

x402 TLDR:
An open source protocol that leverages the 402 payment request HTTP status code. It’s part of Google’s AP2 standard with an upcoming foundation by Cloudflare and Coinbase with companies like Freepick, Browserbase and Firecrawling providing their services on top of it.

It lets you monetize your endpoints with micro payments (no transaction fees) and pay-per-use. Because it happens over HTTP and the endpoints are pay gated there’s no need for api keys making it perfect for Ai agents to access api tools and services without facing account signups
