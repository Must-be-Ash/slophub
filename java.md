  Current (HTML + CSS only):

  Pros:
  - ✅ Fast, lightweight
  - ✅ Works perfectly in iframes
  - ✅ No security concerns
  - ✅ Zero runtime errors
  - ✅ Universal compatibility

  Cons:
  - ❌ Limited interactivity
  - ❌ No form validation
  - ❌ Can't do carousels, accordions, modals
  - ❌ No scroll animations
  - ❌ Missing modern landing page features

  If we allow JavaScript:

  Pros:
  - ✅ Lead capture forms with validation
  - ✅ Interactive elements (carousels, tabs, accordions)
  - ✅ Scroll animations (fade in, parallax)
  - ✅ Countdown timers for urgency
  - ✅ Exit intent popups
  - ✅ Analytics/tracking integration
  - ✅ Video controls
  - ✅ Much more engaging pages

  Cons:
  - ⚠️ Potential security issues (XSS)
  - ⚠️ Could break if JS errors
  - ⚠️ Might be blocked in some iframes
  - ⚠️ Slightly slower

  My Recommendation:

  Yes, allow JavaScript - but with constraints:

  1. Inline only (no external CDNs)
  2. No eval() or dangerous functions
  3. Vanilla JS (no framework dependencies)
  4. Keep it simple - just for interactivity

  Modern landing pages really benefit from:
  - Form validation
  - Smooth scroll animations
  - Interactive carousels
  - Modal popups
